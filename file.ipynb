      " The Transformer is a new network architecture proposed for sequence transduction tasks (like machine translation), which relies entirely on attention mechanisms instead of using recurrence or convolutions. It follows an encoder-decoder structure and uses stacked self-attention to compute its input and output representations. Self-attention allows the Transformer to relate different positions within a single sequence, and it has been successfully applied to various tasks such as reading comprehension, summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations. The Transformer is shown to be superior in quality compared to existing models while being more parallelizable and requiring less training time.\n"
